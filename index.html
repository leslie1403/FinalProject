    <h2>Top Violations</h2>

      <img src="images/top_violations.jpg" alt="Bar graph showing the 5 violations in ward 42">
      <figcaption>Figure 1: This shows the top 5 ticket violations in Ward 42, which is in the downtown area of Chicago.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>When looking at the figure above the top 5 violations present in Ward 42 can be seen. Considering that Ward 42 in
      Chicago lies deep within the Central Business District, it comes to no surprise that expired meters is a top
      violation for this ward. Moreover, two counts involving expired meters are represented in the chart. Similarly,
      the rest of the violations are related to parking issues. All of these violations can be refuted, and using the
      figure it can be seen that there is success in challenging these violation tickets.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/dismisal_percentage.jpg" alt="proportions of successful violation dismissals in ward 42">
      <figcaption>Figure 2: This shows the proportions of successful dismissals when compared to other violations in the
        top 5 ticket violations for Ward 42 in Chicago.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The other non-dismissed tickets in the second figure represent bankruptcy, paid, hearing required, court, define,
      and notice which describes the status of the ticket. The other status' are irrelevant in this instance. A quick
      glance at the chart suggests that the proportion of successful dismissals for each of the top 5 violations in
      Chicago lie close to 10%. It may not seem like much, but keep in mind that there are a lot of tickets given that
      these tickets are issued in Chicago's Central Business District which is fairly busy and dense in population.</p>
